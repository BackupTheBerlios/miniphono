Ixion is a media player written in C/C++ using wxWidgets and GStreamer.
It is not a bleeding edge, full-featured, eye-candy, all-in-one 
application. Ixion exists only because I needed a video player that could
play at double or half speed. However, it can be useful if you want to see
how to write a simple app based in wxWidgets and/or GStreamer. I will
probably never make Ixion 0.2.

All the code based in GStreamer is in one single file: video.c. It has
been designed to provide a generic interface to the rest of the application
(see video.h). This way it should be fairly easy to make Ixion work with
some other media library, such as Mplayer or Xine. Just rewrite video.c.

In theory everything should be portable, but I have only tested it in my
Linux box. There are a few lines that depend on GTK+2 and another few
that expect to have an X-window environment (Xv).

See INSTALL for installation insttructions.

Well... just play with those tiny little buttons ;)

If you have problems with audio, you can start Ixion with audio disabled:

	$ ixion -noaudio
