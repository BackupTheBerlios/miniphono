Known bugs
----------

 * Sound is not available when playing at double or half speed.
 * If you use the speed buttons while in playing state, the app becomes
slow/unstable. Don't do that. Press Stop, then change the speed, then Play.
 * The ffwd and rew buttons are unstable when playing at double or half 
speed.
 * When playing a video for the first time, audio and video are not 
correctly synchronized. If you play with Stop/ffwd/rew buttons, they might
syncronize :P .
 * Ixion fails to play video if the X server does not support Xv.
 * Ixion fails to play certain video formats due to an internal GStreamer bug
   with the vdrop element that enables speed changing (at least, that's what
   I think :-P ).
